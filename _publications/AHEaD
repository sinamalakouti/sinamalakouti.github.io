This paper introduces CULTIVate, a benchmark for evaluating cultural faithfulness in text-to-image models using cross-cultural everyday activities.
It proposes descriptor-based metrics to measure cultural alignment, hallucination, and exaggeration, and shows that current models perform unevenly across regions, with stronger results for Global North cultures.
