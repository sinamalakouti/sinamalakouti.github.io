Sina is a Computer Science Ph.D student at the University of Pittsburgh under the supervision of [Prof. Adriana Kovashka](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/). Sina's research interests lie in computer vision, multimodal learning (e.g., vision-language models), and generative AI, aiming to build a more robust and generalizable system that can understand and reason about complex visual data. He is currently working on:

- Multimodal & abstract Reasoning: Multimodal Reasoning and Diffusion Models
- Domain Robustness: Multimodal domain generalization, generalization across geographies, etc. 
- Generative AI: text-to-image/creative & persuasive generation.

## Prior and Current Experiences
Before starting my PhD at Upitt, Sina defended my BSc in Software Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. During my BSc, Sina was an intern at Shahid Rajaei Hospital & Research Center under the supervision of Dr. Oveisi and as an Undergraduate research intern at Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany, supervised by Prof. Stefan Kramer and Dr. Zahra Ahmadi in the Summer of 2018. During his PhD, Sina spend three summers at Apple, eBay, and Amazon as an intern.
