I'm a final-year Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pittsburgh, advised by [Prof. Adriana Kovashka](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/).

My research interests are computer vision, multimodal learning, and foundational models (understanding and generative), aiming to build robust and generalizable systems that can understand and reason about complex visual data. During my Ph.D., I have interned at Apple, eBay, and Amazon. Prior to that, I received my B.S. in Software Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, where I received an outstanding student award and visited Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz as a research intern.

I'm currently working on the following problems, with research appearing in NeurIPS'25, CVPR'24, WACV'25, and BMVC'23:

- Multimodal & abstract Reasoning: Multimodal Reasoning, compositional reasoning, and Diffusion Models.
- Domain Robustness: Multimodal domain generalization, generalization across geographies, etc. 
- Generative AI: text-to-image, compositional generaiton and generalization.
