Sina is a Computer Science Ph.D student at the University of Pittsburgh under the supervision of [Prof. Adriana Kovashka](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/). Sina's research interests lie in computer vision, multimodal learning (e.g., vision-language models), and generative AI, aiming to build a more robust and generalizable system that can understand and reason about complex visual data. He is currently working on:

- Multimodal & abstract Reasoning: Multimodal Reasoning and Diffusion Models
- Domain Robustness: Multimodal domain generalization, generalization across geographies, etc. 
- Generative AI: text-to-image/creative & persuasive generation.
