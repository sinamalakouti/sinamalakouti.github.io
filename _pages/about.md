Sina is a Computer Science Ph.D student at the University of Pittsburgh under the supervision of [Prof. Adriana Kovashka](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/). Sina's research interests lie in computer vision, multimodal learning (e.g., vision-language models), and generative AI, aiming to build a more robust and generalizable system that can understand and reason about complex visual data. He is currently working on:

- Multimodal & abstract Reasoning: Multimodal Reasoning, compositional reasoning, and Diffusion Models.
- Domain Robustness: Multimodal domain generalization, generalization across geographies, etc. 
- Generative AI: text-to-image, compositional generaiton and generalization.

## Prior and Current Experiences
Before starting his PhD at Upitt, Sina defended his BSc in Software Engineering, focusing on Artificial Intelligence. During his BSc, Sina was an intern at Shahid Rajaei Hospital & Research Center under the supervision of [Dr. Mehrdad Oveisi](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/mehrdad-oveisi) and an undergraduate research intern at Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany, supervised by [Prof. Stefan Kramer](https://www.datamining.informatik.uni-mainz.de/stefan-kramer/) and [Dr. Zahra Ahmadi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QdQRYyAAAAAJ&hl=en) in the Summer of 2018. During his PhD, Sina spent three summers at Apple, eBay, and Amazon as research intern.
